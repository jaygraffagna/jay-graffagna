      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        My life is much more than my occupation and projects I've
        worked on. I'm a dad to a toddler, Sawyer, and married to my partner,
        Abbey. We live in the Des Moines area. It's a cool small city with a lot
        going on. When I am not at work, I spend a lot of my time away from screens 
        spending time outside with my family.

        I live my life everyday with these things in mind: kindness, patience,
        and happiness. I try to take a step back every once in a while and remind
        myself about two philosophies. Life is a celebration and the journey is
        the goal.

        I am a lover of nature and the arts. I think a lot about what our
        landscapes would be like in their natural state before the settlement of
        humans. When people ask me what I would be if I wasn't a developer, I
        would be a naturalist. I am far from an expert on naturalism and native
        ecosystems, but I love learning from experts and participating in the
        protection of native habitats. My partner Abbey is an artist and we
        both have a passion for the arts. We like getting out and
        seeing public art or connecting with the local art community. I have
        dabbled a bit in photography and pastel paintings, but don't have much
        to show for it. My all time favorite thing to do is go to live music. I
        have been to many shows and they all kind of blur together (in a good
        way). It has allowed me to experience some amazing artists and venues.

        My hobbies include biking, hiking, and kayaking (really anything to get
        me outdoors). I run and do yoga for exercise. In the warm months, I am
        out in the garden attempting to grow something. When I'm inside, I spend
        my down time listening to music or reading a sci-fi/fantasy novel.
